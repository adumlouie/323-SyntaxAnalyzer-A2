# Adam, Douglas, Steven's super kawaii syntax analyzer ðŸ¥¶

# TO DO

- rewrite grammar to remove any left recursion âœ…
- write functions for the all of the generated production rules
- use the lexer() function generated from assignment 1 to get the tokens
  - also adjust the lexer function to account for what he said
- make sure the parser prints to an output file the tokens, lexemes, and production rules used
- create error function that generates token, lexeme, line number, error type etc
